Enterprise Trading Bot Skeleton (Risk-First Architecture)


A robust, enterprise-grade skeleton for building scalable and maintainable trading bots, architected around Risk-First Architecture (RFA) principles. This template uses Flask and includes a full CI/CD pipeline, containerization, and best-practice project structure.
Overview
This repository provides a production-ready foundation for a new trading microservice. It is built on the core principle that risk management must be a foundational, sequential component, not an afterthought. Every trading action is intercepted by a mandatory risk-validation gate before execution.
This skeleton uses a Flask-based application factory pattern, pre-request middleware for risk validation, a modular risk engine, and includes built-in support for configuration management, automated testing, and containerized deployments with Docker.
Features
 * Risk-First Architecture: Pre-request middleware intercepts and validates all trading requests.
 * Modular Risk Engine: Decouples risk logic from trading and API logic.
 * Application Factory Pattern: Scalable and testable Flask structure.
 * Containerized: Ready for deployment with Docker and Gunicorn.
 * Automated CI/CD: Linting, testing, and build pipeline using GitHub Actions.
 * Dependency Management: Managed via Poetry for reliable builds.
